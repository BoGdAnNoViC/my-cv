          My name is Bogdan and Iâ€™m a sociable and very enthusiastic person.
          Most of all I am desire, effort and determination. I enjoy learning
          new things every day. Over the years I've gained a lot of knowledge
          from the world of leisure, and now I'm reworking myself on IT, where I
          saw that the possibilities for growth are very high and learning never
          ends.
